\r
The Defra air quality grant will be used to establish a pilot project over an 18-month period which will focus on behaviour change in a specific area of the city.\r
\r
In a continuation of previous joint working with the University of Leicester on Exposure to Air Quality Dependent on Transport Mode, UoL have outlined how they can achieve our goal of reducing air pollution in the defined location of the project by completing two areas of work:\r
\r
1.	Investigation into wood burning sources of PM2.5\r
•	Biomass burning is a source of atmospheric PM2.5. Levoglucosan generated through biomass burning can be used to calculate wood burning fraction of PM2.5.\r
•	Using filters placed in two or more locations, the contribution of wood burning to atmospheric aerosol can be identified.\r
\r
2.	Conducting detailed analysis of AQ monitor and map data and supporting traffic and wood burning fraction data, developing data-based public engagement strategies\r
\r
Due to previous joint working, where this project builds on work completed together from 2019/20 - 2020/21, together with time constraints between being awarded the funding and starting the project, the best course of action would be to secure services of UoL and to apply for the waiver.

DCC is seeking bids from OFGEM licensed energy providers that can deliver a white label gas and electricity product.

In December 2016 DCC and Derbyshire County Council conducted soft market testing to assess the viability of forming a white label arrangement with licensed energy providers. The soft market testing has helped us as an organisation clarify what is possible and how it aligns to our corporate goals. We have also taken the view that we will work independently, and not in conjunction with the County Council; however, we will explore possibilities for marketing in non-City areas in the future.

As part of this exercise, we are inviting companies to state how they will meet our vision and then propose draft terms and conditions for a white label arrangement.

The Authority operates eight waste landfill sites throughout the county of Lancashire. The leachate collection and treatment systems at each site are designed to collect and/or collect and treat leachate prior to its discharge to foul sewer. A leachate is any liquid that has passed through materials and has extracted solutes, suspended solids or any other component of the material through which it has passed. In this case the leachates extract components from the landfill waste and thus become harmful to the environment and may give rise to explosive atmospheres within the public sewer network unless it is suitably treated.  
 
The performance of the Council&#039;s landfill drainage treatment systems is regulated by United Utilities Plc and the Environment Agency. The Authority has a responsibility to manage closed landfill sites as well as enforcing environmental standards, as per various legislative requirements such as Environmental Protection Act 1990, Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 and Water Industry Act 1991. Therefore it is important that the systems designed to achieve these responsibilities are effectively cleaned and maintained.

The Customer work is to generate income for the Client so that it may subsidise its public service commitments.

The Client intends to appoint up to 4 (four) Suppliers to each lot of the Framework.

The Client proposes to make this Framework available to eligible contracting authorities and charities within the geographic regions of: Leicestershire (Lot 1 - Leicestershire), Derbyshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland (Lot 2 - The East Midlands) and Staffordshire, Warwickshire and West Midlands (Lot 3 - The West Midlands)

It is not possible to ascertain the precise value which may be generated via the Client and Customers. However, based on the financial year 17/18 the Client&#039;s spend was &pound;50,000. The value may increase as a result of the following:

a) the Client increasing its own Client/Property portfolio
b) budgets made available to the Client
c) successful Joint Bidding defined in 2.4
d) where new Customer&#039;s call off from the Framework
e) the Client experiences consecutive failures across several sites resulting in a higher volume of call outs

However, it is recognised that they currently have different collection regimes for residual household waste (HDC collecting alternate weekly and BDBC collecting weekly) and therefore, in order to identify potential savings and service efficiencies, the authority is (subject to BDBC Cabinet approval in March 2017) also seeking a separate price for operating a contract under which BDBC and HDC both provide alternate weekly collections for residual waste and dry recycling.

The authority is also seeking Potential suppliers views on introducing a range of other optional services, including a kerbside textile collection using plastic sacks which would be placed out with either the refuse or recycling containers.

The service is managed by HDC on behalf of both BDBC and HDC under an inter-authority agreement and a single Client team, thereby ensuring efficiencies and clarity of accountability for the contractor.  
The contract is also supported by one Contact Centre, but this could change in the future so contractors need to be aware that they could be working with two centres with differing IT systems.

The new HWRC must be sited on suitable land (planning and environmental permitting wise) between 1 and 5 hectares in size. The timescales for this project are tight and therefore to achieve delivery within this timescale, it is desirable for the site to either have an existing waste or industrial use.

The HWRC must be able to accept the full list of waste streams accepted at KCC HWRCs, as set out below:
•	Green waste;
•	Residual;
•	Bulky;
•	Metal;
•	Wood;
•	Paper and Card;

The design of the site should follow the waste hierarchy with reuse first, followed by recycling bays and lastly residual to encourage customers to consider how they dispose of their waste.
The HWRC shall be open to the public seven days a week in line with the rest of KCC&#039;s network of sites.
•	Monday to Saturday: 8am - 4:30pm
•	Sunday and bank holidays: 9am - 4pm
